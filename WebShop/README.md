Information system for companies engaged in the assembly and sale of various personal computers.

**Computer components**

As a company, we maintain a catalog of various computer components available on the market. Each component has a price (in euros).


**Components needed to build one computer**
Processor (CPU)
Graphics card (GPU)
Memory (RAM)
Motherboard
Hard Disk Drive (HDD / SSD)
Power supply unit (PSU)

**Compatibility of components**
There is a separate slot on the motherboard for each component (except the power supply). The sockets also have different standards, such as:

- Processors have a specific slot type that must match the slot type on the motherboard (eg LGA1151, LGA1150, AM4, AM1, etc.)
- Hard disks also come in several different types for motherboard compatibility: e.g. SATA, M.2, PCIe, etc.
- For a video card, the motherboard must have at least one PCIe 16x slot.
- There are different generation standards for memory (eg DDR3, DDR4, etc.). To use DDR4 memory on your computer, the slot on the motherboard must support this standard.

**Information system requirements**
- keeping a "catalog" of components and their prices
- determining the compatibility of components (sockets, power supply capacity)
- placing an order (price, usecase) and building the best computer accordingly
